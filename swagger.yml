      operationId: Flight Inspiration Search
      summary: The Flight Inspiration Search API lets you go beyond the traditional search by origin, destination and dates to meet the needs of travelers looking for suggestions and a search experience that reflects the way they choose their trip. This can help you answer the question "Where can I go within a given travel budget?" 
      description: |
        The Inspiration Flight Search allows you to find the prices of return flights from an origin city without necessarily having a destination, or even a flight date, in mind. The search doesn't return a distinct set of price options, but rather, can tell you the price of flying from a given city to some destination, for a trip of a given duration, that falls within a given date range.

        The search is based on our Extreme Search platform, which continually caches a large number of flight search results from a list of origin cities to a variety of destinations. Since it's a cached search, the response time is fast, but not all origin airports are available. Here is a list of the currently supported origin-destination airport pairs. We try to keep this list as fresh as possible for you, but be aware that it may not always be exactly up-to-date and it can change without warning.

        Despite this limitation don't underestimate the power of this API. Thanks to its quick response speed you can easily pair it with other APIs to provide a low fare and inspiration for any destination. For example, you can could combine it with a event search API and suggest a total price to see go and see an concert or a game in a selection of cities.

      operationId: Flight Extensive Search
      summary: The Extensive Flight Search API allows building travel searches based on very flexible and open range of dates. You can use it to answer questions such as "When is the best date to fly...".  It's built on Amadeus' Featured Results technology, which returns thousands of results (prices, itineraries and dates) in a matter of milliseconds. Results are available over half a calendar year with a 1 to 15 day stay duration    
      description: |
        The Extensive Flight Search allows you to find the prices of return flights between two airports over a large number of dates, and for a large variety of stay durations. The search doesn't return exact itineraries, but rather tells you the best price for a flight on a given day, for a stay of a given duration.

        The search is based on our Extreme Search platform, which continually caches a large number of flight search results from a list of origin cities to a variety of destinations. Since it's a cached search, the response time is fast, but not all origin airports are available. Here is a list of the currently supported origin-destination airport pairs. We try to keep this list as fresh as possible for you, but be aware that it may not always be exactly up-to-date and it can change without warning.

        That said, a price graph like this provides a powerful bargin shopping tool - allowing travelers with flexible itineraries to identify days on which they can get the cheapest flights to their destinations.

      summary: The Low-Fare Search API lets you find the cheapest one way or return itineraries and fares between two airports at specific dates.
      description: This is the low fare search engine Amadeus uses to retrieve the best price for flights, based on our latest Master Pricer Travel Board technology. This document describes how to make a low fare search and how to handle the returned messages. The message is composed of multiple results for given request. A result is defined by a unique combination of price, tax, passenger type, fare type, cabin, and availability for each requested segment. A result is then composed of single or multiple itineraries. Each itinerary is composed of an outbound leg, and, if a return date was specified, an inbound leg. Each leg is composed of a list of one or more flights, that the traveller will be required to take in order to get from the origin airport to the destination airport.

      summary: The Location Information API allows you to quickly find out more information about any IATA city or airport location code. With this API, you can find information such as city and airport names and locations, as well as information on timezones and airport usage.
      description: |
        This service retrieves the location information corresponding to a IATA city or airport code.
      
        When provided with an IATA code, the service determines whether this code could relate to a city code, an airport code or both. If the city could contain multiple airports, it will return all possible airports that correspond to that city code.

        This API is based on the Amadeus supported [Geobases](http://opentraveldata.github.io/geobases/) open-source project. If you wish to make your own database with all IATA location information, in order to get faster reponses, you can download the latest raw data from [their github page](https://github.com/opentraveldata/geobases). The exact file used for this API is [ori_por_public.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opentraveldata/geobases/public/GeoBases/DataSources/Por/Ori/ori_por_public.csv).

      summary: The Airport Autocomplete API provides a simple means to find an IATA location code for flight search based on a city or airport name. The API is fully JQuery-Autocomplete compatible to enable you to quickly build a drop-down list for your users to find the right airport easily. 
      description: |
        Given the start of any word in an airport's official name, a city name, or the start of an IATA code, this API provides the full name and IATA location code of the city or airport, for use in flight searches. Only major cities and civilian airports with several commercial flights per week are included by default. The response provides up to 20 possible matches, sorted by importance, in a [JQuery UI Autocomplete](http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/) compatible format. [This sample implementation](https://github.com/amadeus-travel-innovation-sandbox/sandbox-content/blob/master/airport-autocomplete-template.html) using JQuery UI may help. This API uses data from the OpenTravelData project, see [optd_por_public.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opentraveldata/opentraveldata/master/opentraveldata/optd_por_public.csv).

        The value returned is the IATA location code. The label returned is always in UTF-8 format, with the airport official name (which is often in the native language), in the format of English City Name (if not already included in the airport name) - Airport Name [AIRPORT IATA CODE].

      operationId: Nearest Relevant Airport
      summary: The Nearest Relevant Airport can find the most useful nearby airport to a given location.
      description: |
        This service gives the most relevant airports in a radius of 500 km around the given coordinates. The relevance of an airport is computed by dividing the number of airport movements (take offs and landings) by the distance from the point. This causes the relevance of an airport to increase exponentially as you approach it.

        To minimize response time, all distances are computed as a [great-circle distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance) from the provided coordinates to the airport coordinates, and thus do not take into account traffic conditions, international boundaries, mountains, water, or other elements that might make the a nearby airport hard to reach.

        Only civilian airports with at least several commercial flights per week are included in the results.

        The result is a list of airports sorted by decreasing relevance. It always contains the nearest airport with significant commercial traffic.

      summary: The Car Rental API uses Amadeus' classic car service to locate the best available car. Define a circular area with one coordinate and radius, or provide an airport code, as well as the pick-up and drop-off dates, and get a list of car rental providers with their locations and rates. Optional parameters such as currency and rental provider codes are also available and can be used to narrow down the results. This API is an ideal pairing with the flight and hotel search to provide ground transportation options at the destination.

        With this API you can find out the price and type of car, for all car rental providers, near a specified airport.

        You can quickly see the locations of car providers near a given airport, and what cars are available to rent, and at what prices. This API is based on our classic car pricing service that gets live availability from car providers, and is used to power a variety of airline and travel agency websites.
                   
        Results are validated from car providers, and thus response times may take up to 10 seconds (response times are typically about 5s), and the number of concurrent calls is throttled per user to avoid flooding our provider's systems. However, this means the final result is guaranteed to be live and accurate.

        The configuration of this API allows search for car rentals in the rental location where the car is picked up (at the start of the rental), is the same as the one where it will be dropped off.
